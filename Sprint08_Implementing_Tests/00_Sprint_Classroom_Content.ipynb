    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_design\n",
    "\n",
    ">Confirmatory research tests a priori hypotheses — outcome predictions that are made before the measurement phase begins. Such a priori hypotheses are usually derived from a theory or the results of previous studies. The advantage of confirmatory research is that the result is more meaningful, in the sense that it is much harder to claim that a certain result is generalizable beyond the data set. The reason for this is that in confirmatory research, one ideally strives to reduce the probability of falsely reporting a coincidental result as meaningful. This probability is known as α-level or the probability of a type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Exploratory research on the other hand seeks to generate a posteriori hypotheses by examining a data-set and looking for potential relations between variables. It is also possible to have an idea about a relation between variables but to lack knowledge of the direction and strength of the relation. If the researcher does not have any specific hypotheses beforehand, the study is exploratory with respect to the variables in question (although it might be confirmatory for others). The advantage of exploratory research is that it is easier to make new discoveries due to the less stringent methodological restrictions. Here, the researcher does not want to miss a potentially interesting relation and therefore aims to minimize the probability of rejecting a real effect or relation; this probability is sometimes referred to as β and the associated error is of type II. In other words, if the researcher simply wants to see whether some measured variables could be related, he would want to increase the chances of finding a significant result by lowering the threshold of what is deemed to be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Sometimes, a researcher may conduct exploratory research but report it as if it had been confirmatory ('Hypothesizing After the Results are Known', HARKing—see Hypotheses suggested by the data); this is a questionable research practice bordering on fraud."

    "\n",
    ">Most formal (confirmatory) statistical analyses are based on models. Statis- tical models are ideal, mathematical representations of observable characteristics. Models are best divided into two components. **The structural component of the model (or structural model) specifies the relationships between explana- tory variables and the mean (or other key feature) of the outcome variables**. The **“random” or “error” component of the model (or error model) characterizes the deviations of the individual observations from the mean**. (Here, “error” does not indicate “mistake”.) The two model components are also called **“signal” and “noise”** respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Statisticians realize that no mathematical models are perfect representations of the real world, but some are close enough to reality to be useful. A full description of a model should include all assumptions being made because statistical inference is impossible without assumptions, and sufficient deviation of reality from the assumptions will invalidate any statistical inferences.\n",
