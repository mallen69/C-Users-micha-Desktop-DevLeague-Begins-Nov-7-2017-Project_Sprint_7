[Sprint Topic] Sprint Journal for [Author]
DAY 1: Tuesday (Week 1)
Ideas for Projects
Import 5 months of Biki trip data into a Biki Trips database in SQlite Studio
Each month is it's own seperate data file and each will be imported as a seperate table. This should be relatively easy as I know how to create a new database and add tables, but I previously imported only a limited amount of the file and I'm concerned about each file being too big.

Combine 5 month's of Biki trips into a single table by stacking the 5 tables

I will utilize the "union" function, which I need to learn

Create a data structure that includes a Trips table as a primary table

I will utilize the "SELECT/INSERT INTO" function, which I need to practice

Move redundant information into a Stations table, Products table, and Customer table

I will utilize the "SELECT/INSERT INTO" function, which I need to practice

Execute all possible SQL quieries to test the utility of each function on my dataset

I will utilize the quieries and functions listed in our Classroom Content
What I Expect to Learn
I expect to familiarize myself with the functions of SQL and the relvency to my data set
Project References
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_distinct_keyword.htm this function will work with my table with all my trips and for a given coloumn, I want to select station name, this table of unique. This is going to isolate station and station IDs
https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science these courses will familiarize me with

Replace with description of how project relates to sprint content
DAY 2: Wednesday (Week 1)
Pitch Feedback
Ben suggested I use Rstudio instead of SQL

Prototype Notes
I downloaded 4 seperate csv files (July trips data, August trips data, September trips data, and October trips data)

I read them in Rstudio, then I made short cuts to read them, and I did a coupe commands on them I learned from Tori

Here is some R code I learned from Michael and utilized

getwd() -> get working directory

setwd("/Users/justine/Desktop/DevLeague/Biki Trips Data") -> set working directory to the folder my files are at

read.csv("July.csv") -> read each biki trip file read.csv("August.csv") read.csv("September.csv") read.csv("October.csv")

July=read.csv("July.csv") -> Simplify the command to read the file August=read.csv("August.csv") September=read.csv("September.csv") October=read.csv("October.csv")

Pair Show & Tell Comments
Comments from prototype discussion

These comments lead into plan development. Key considerations for me and my partner: Do I have a plan? Is my plan feasible?

Proposed Plan: Key Milestones by Day
Day 2 (Wed Week 1):
Develop Project Proposal
Push Docs / Repo / Roadmap Update
Day 3 (Thu Week 1):
Make a script to combine the reading commands for my files
Learn to save my work in rstudio
Push docs / repo
Day 4 (Tue Week 2):
Play with manipulations/functions/commands. "rbind()" is one command suggested to "stack" my tables together
Find out what commands can extract redundant data from Trips table into a new table
Push docs / repo
Day 5 (Wed Week 2):
Project highlights
Identify question or cohort knowledge gap for sprint review
Develop Topic Project + Presentation
Push Repo / docs / Presentation
Project Definition and README.MD Discussion
This is a discussion of how this project will fit into my overall roadmap. I will update my roadmap with the following project definition

I will focus my project Repo's README.MD on the same topic, but with this additional detail.

DAY 3: Thursday (Week 1)
Setup for Repo and Documentation Push
Setup and testing I did to make sure my repo and documentation were ready to push at the end of the day

Repo File Strategy Discussion
How I will present my repo files for clarity and demonstration

Day 6: Thursday (Week 2)
Things I didn't get to
*Here are some ideas that I didn't get to implement, but wanted to. I will be adding these to my roadmap table entry for this sprint as well.
