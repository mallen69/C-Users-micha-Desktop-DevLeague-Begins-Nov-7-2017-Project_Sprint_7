    "### What I Expect to Learn\n",
    "* I would like to learn how to perform data operations on data in a SQL database.  This includes filtering, adding columns, and performing calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project References\n",
    "- Analyzing historical menu data from New York Public Library: https://www.kaggle.com/nypl/whats-on-the-menu -- But what questions?\n",
    "- UFO sightings data (only one table): https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/data\n",
    "- Wine data: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data\n",
    "- SQL Tutorial: https://data36.com/sql-for-data-analysis-tutorial-beginners/\n",
    "- For future project? Game of Thrones: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones/data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Pitch\n",
    "- Language/program comparison: Export my OrangeTheory results from the past 6 months to get: count of sessions; sum of splat points; average of heart rate; sum of calories burned; average of calories burned; average attendance per week; where splat points were under 12; max calories burned, min calories burned\n",
    "- SQL only: Find a large data set from Kaggle to examine patterns/queries in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Important link not related to sprint: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/\n",
    "- SQL's primary goal is to manage and structure data.  Its goal is not to perform analysis.  Calculations are sums, but not statistically significant analysis.\n",
    "- Commands shown in summary content is fairly comprehensive list of commands.\n",
    "- SQL can subset/filter/choose, and also creates joins to return tables.\n",
    "- Group by example: Sum revenue by station ID; for me, sum revenue by HHC tower\n",
    "- Join on: on a specific field\n",
    "- Union: Combining tables together by pasting rows together\n",
    "- Into: Putting into temporary tables; to check to see if query is running but the database is too large. Do a limit for top 100 rows and then put them into a temp table.  Then perform manipulation on the temp table.\n",
    "- From: Use when you have more than one database.\n",
    "- Command line will probably always be in use.  But SQL GUI editors would also be used on the job.\n",
    "- Update: Edit a row\n",
    "- Create Index / Drop Index: Index controls unique IDs; affects efficiency of table - can run much faster.\n",
    "- For huge data sets, skill is agility in subsetting out data to size you can manage.\n",
    "- Data dictionary: Explains what each field means. Part of the documenation process for setting up a data.  By a database administrator.\n",
    "- Vector: List-like object.  However, data types must be homogenous.\n",
    "- List in R: can have different data types.  A list can store vectors.\n",
    "- Data frames: Brought in to R through library.  Implements table structure.  Uses lists and vectors.  Constructs lists of columns.\n",
    "- In interactive environments, these are easily tested.  Project work will allow us to self-experiment.\n",
    "- Tibbles: Table in R.  Like a variant of data frame.  Updated version of data frame.  Works with packages like Tidyverse.  CRAN includes it.\n",
    "- In R: observations are rows and variables are columns.\n",
    "- What are objects in R??\n",
    "- NAN = not a number\n",
    "- N/A\n",
    "- Different libraries treat NANs differently\n",
    "- In R, \"variables\" are equivalent to columns\n",
    "- Nat recommends SQLDBM to visualize data models."

Using boolean queries, we determined that this is read as a value larger than 0.  In order to perform calculations on this column, I needed to modify the query to remove the empty string values.  I could have also updated the values but it would be techncially incorrect to assign it a value like 0.  I might have had to make it a null field.
