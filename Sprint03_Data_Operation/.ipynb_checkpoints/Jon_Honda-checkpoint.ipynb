    "### What I Expect to Learn\n",
    "* If someone asks me what data serialization is, what would I say?\n",
    "* What is pickling?\n",
    "* What are some specific efficiencies gained by using data serialization?\n",
    "* How is serialized data stored in a SQLite database?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project References\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Pitch\n",
    "* I will explore how data serialization in python can be used to more efficiently store and retrieve database data from one data field instead of multiple fields. This should allow me to reduce the number of data tables and code needed to interact with data tables\n",
    "\n",
    "* I propose to implement pickling in python to serialize data about mathematical expressions stored in a database. Serialization should reduce the number of data tables and python code development since we can store multiple pieces of information about an expression in a serialized data field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach \n",
    "1. Define a bunch of expressions, including variables, variable data types, if variable is itself another expression\n",
    "2. Sketch out how you would approach this problem w/o data serialization\n",
    "3. Explore pickling - how to use it, how to store nested data\n",
    "4. Is recursion still needed to make system work?\n",
    "5. Fog of uncertainty so thick....can't see what to do after this.\n"

    "#### Warning The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### more info: What is a pickle?  \n",
    "#### “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”; however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”."
