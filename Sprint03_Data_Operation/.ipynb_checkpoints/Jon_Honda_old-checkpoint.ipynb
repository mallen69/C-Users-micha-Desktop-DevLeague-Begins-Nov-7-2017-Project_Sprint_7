    "# Serial Data Slayer - killing inefficiencies with data serialization\n",
    "#### 12/11/17 | Jon Honda | Sprint #3\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a data engineer, I need to understand how to implement data serialization So that I can implement data solutions more efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "I propose to implement pickling in python to serialize data about mathematical expressions stored in a database. Serialization should reduce the number of data tables and python code development since we can store multiple pieces of information about an expression in a serialized data field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "- If someone asks me what data serialization is, what would I say?\n",
    "- What is pickling?\n",
    "- What are some specific efficiencies gained by using data serialization?\n",
    "- How is serialized data stored in a SQLite database?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- A running list of things that I'm learning and don't want to forget\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach \n",
    "1. Define a bunch of expressions, including variables, variable data types, if variable is itself another expression\n",
    "2. Sketch out how you would approach this problem w/o data serialization\n",
    "3. Explore pickling - how to use it, how to store nested data\n",
    "4. Is recursion still needed to make system work?\n",
    "5. Fog of uncertainty so thick....can't see what to do after this.\n",

    "## BIG WARNING:\n",
    "#### Warning The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### more info: What is a pickle?  \n",
    "#### “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”; however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”."
