    "### Project References\n",
    "- https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sql-tutorial-introduction\n",
    "    - This website had more explanations on different functions that you can run in SQL. I thought that was interesting and helpful.\n",
    "- https://data36.com/sql-for-data-analysis-tutorial-beginners/\n",
    "    - This website is going to help me figure out what to do with my data and upload it in an effective way.\n",
    "    - https://data36.com/sql-where-clause-tutorial-beginners-ep2/\n",
    "        - Learn about the \"WHERE clause\"\n",
    "- https://www.statmethods.net/r-tutorial/index.html\n",
    "    - I want to see what I can do with the information in not only SQL but also see why its valuable to know about R. \n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Pitch\n",
    "- My idea for my project is to take HART data and import it into SQL, I was really interested in SQL last time I worked with it so I wanted to expand upon what I learned. I dont really know whats in the data set so the goal would be just to manipulate the data and organize it in a way that is readable, may come up with a few questions to ask along the way so i can use multiple SQL query functions. I would like to use SQL for the first day and then for the second day move into R and see what is possible in R that maybe wasnt in SQL, or even use the same query functionsm but just in R. \n",
    "- This relates to the sprint because I will be manipulating data through SQL and R. Im hope that after this project I will know which functions to use in order to get answers for different sets of data as well as being more fluent in both SQL and R."
