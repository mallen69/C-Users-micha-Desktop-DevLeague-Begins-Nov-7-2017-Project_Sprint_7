    "* How to write a **for** loop in R\n",
    "* The basics of data types in R (e.g., vector, list, matrix, data frame, tibble, etc)\n",

    "- Use R to scrape tables of data about various crops from thousands of webpages at a website. Once scraped the data will need to be added to a single data frame and output into a csv or other widelt accessible format. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Stretch Goal 1: Scrape a metadata matrix with multiple uses for each crop, add the crop key to each use, and compile all uses of all crops into a data frame.\n",
    "- Stretch Goal 2: Run the scrape/append process in paralell to speed up processing time\n",

    "1. Started setting up Git within RStudio for more streamlined version tracking. [This tutorial](https://nicercode.github.io/git/) was a big help.\n",
    "2. Completed the [Intro to SQL for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science) tutorial on [DataCamp](datacamp.com)."

This can mean pre-viewing a subset of it, summarizing the columns/attributes/features, sorting or reorganizing it and otherwise finding ways to immerse yourself in your data. Again, each data tool has something to offer, and our objective is to develop a good sense of the utilities available to you.\n",
