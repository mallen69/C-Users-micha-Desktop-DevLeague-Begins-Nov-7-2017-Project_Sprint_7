    "* Import 5 months of Biki trip data into a Biki Trips database in SQlite Studio\n",
    "- Each month is it's own seperate data file and each will be imported as a seperate table. This should be relatively easy as I know how to create a new database and add tables, but I previously imported only a limited amount of the file and I'm concerned about each file being too big.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combine 5 month's of Biki trips into a single table by stacking the 5 tables\n",
    "- I will utilize the \"union\" function, which I need to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a data structure that includes a Trips table as a primary table\n",
    "- I will utilize the \"SELECT/INSERT INTO\" function, which I need to practice\n",
    "\n",
    "* Move redundant information into a Stations table, Products table, and Customer table\n",
    "- I will utilize the \"SELECT/INSERT INTO\" function, which I need to practice\n",
    "\n",
    "* Execute all possible SQL quieries to test the utility of each function on my dataset\n",
    "- I will utilize the quieries and functions listed in our Classroom Content\n",

    "### What I Expect to Learn\n",
    "* I expect to familiarize myself with the functions of SQL and the relvency to my data set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project References\n",
    "- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_distinct_keyword.htm this function will work with my table with all my trips and for a given coloumn, I want to select station name, this table of unique. This is going to isolate station and station IDs\n",
    "- https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science these courses will familiarize me with \n",
    "- http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-union/ This tutorial will help me combine 5 tables (5 months of biki trip data) and seperate from there\n",
