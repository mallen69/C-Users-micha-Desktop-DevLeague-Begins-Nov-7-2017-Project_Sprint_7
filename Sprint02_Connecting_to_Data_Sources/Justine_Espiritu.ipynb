    "## Day 1 Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're developing project pitches. I want to do the most basic, simpliest one. I'm not sure which other ones require the command line, and I don't have a working one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Pitch Idea 1: Learn the basics of SQL and SQLite. I want to do this so I understand what advantages it has over excel, which is what I normally use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Pitch Idea 2: Creating a SQLite database from my ridership data spreadsheet. I want to do this because it codes observations and may be able to allow me to look at the data and get all the info I want in a quicker snapshot because I can filter out certain fields and only see the relevent data\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Pitch Idea 3: I want to upload multiple system 1st year ridership data into SQL in order to compare and give Biki a benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Pitch Idea 4: Load 6 different revenue data sets into sql to inspect\n",

    "\n",
    "Data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "People who understand SQL can employ the sqlite3 command-line shell (or various third-party SQLite access programs) to analyze large datasets. Raw data can be imported from CSV files, then that data can be sliced and diced to generate a myriad of summary reports. More complex analysis can be done using simple scripts written in Tcl or Python (both of which come with SQLite built-in) or in R or other languages using readily available adaptors. Possible uses include website log analysis, sports statistics analysis, compilation of programming metrics, and analysis of experimental results. Many bioinformatics researchers use SQLite in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same thing can be done with an enterprise client/server database, of course. The advantage of SQLite is that it is easier to install and use and the resulting database is a single file that can be written to a USB memory stick or emailed to a colleague.\n",

    "As a business analyst, I need to understand command line-based applications, basic scripting, databases, web resources, APIs, and data warehouses so that I can compile and organize Biki data effeciently and source other bikeshare system data, and compare effectively.\n",

    "## Day 2 Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what I tried to do on Day 2. Here's some more code\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to create a new database because we want to minimize the data set we're working with, from a couple hundred rows to just ten or so. We successfully uploaded our two datasets as tables to a database but we want to do it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a new database that added to our list of databases in SQlite Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to create tables, and then we want to populate our tables with our datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using https://wiki.sqlitestudio.pl/index.php/User_Manual\n",
    "\n",
    "We are adding a table now https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36390869/how-do-i-add-data-to-a-table-in-sqlite-studio-error-occuring\n",
    "\n",
    "We did a quiery\n",
    "\n",
    "we summed a coloumn. summing a text field is meaningless. Store it as a text and see if it will sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are defining the coloumns data type before populating the table with data. We are going to identify the coloumn with an incorrect data type (i.e. interger as text) to see if SQLite will respect our data type designation\n",
    "\n",
    "So it did populate the text coloumn with an integer/number. Will it sum???? No respect\n",

    "## Here are some overall notes on the skills I learned\n",
    "And perhaps some stream of consciousness notes about what I did, and other questions I might have"
