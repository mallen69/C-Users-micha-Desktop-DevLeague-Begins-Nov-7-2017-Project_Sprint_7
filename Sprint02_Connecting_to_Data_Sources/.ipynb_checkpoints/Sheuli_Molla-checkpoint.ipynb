    "# Explore Data File Types\n",
    "#### [December] | [Sheuli] | [Sprint 2]\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "I worked on researching data file types such as .shp and .json\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As an environmental scientist, I need to be comprotable working with geospatial data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "I propose to find some geospatial data and figure ou what file formats it is stored in. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "- What kind of geospatial data is available for Hawaii?\n",
    "- What file types is the data stored in?\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- There is data about soil, water wetlands and many other environmental things available online. \n",
    "- Most of the data I need to work with is in shape files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach \n",
    "1. FIgure out what data to look for\n",
    "2.Download data\n",
    "3. Figure out file formats\n",
    "4. COmpare file formats\n",
