    "# ROI of an Oscar\n",
    "#### November 30, 2017 | Runjini Murthy | Sprint 2\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "1 to 2 sentence description. The first 5 Sections are mandatory. Free form after that, but there are a couple of suggested categories you can use. But really document however you feel the most comfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a budding data analyst, I need to be able to construct data models so that when I use R to scrape a web site for data, I can structure the format of the database I'd like to query.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a budding data analyst for pop culture websites trying to understand the relationship between movie budgets, Oscar nominations, and box office performance, I need to be able to construct data models so that when I use R to scrape a web site for data, I can structure the format of the database I'd like to query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "My project has three main components: One, I need to construct a data model to represent databases for movies and award categories. Two, I need to build these databases in SQLite. Three, I would like to be able to query the database(s) using SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "- What does my data model look like?\n",
    "- What are the basic commands I need to understand in R?\n",
    "- What are the libraries/packages I need to install in R? \n",
    "- How do I install packages in R?\n",
    "- What is the script to scrape the web?\n",
    "- How do I output a database/table based on the data model I want to create?\n",
    "- Bonus: How do I translate this table into SQLite or something I can access with SQL?  \n",
    "- Bonus: What exactly is SQL, and what environment/program/format do I need to use it?\n",
    "- Bonus: What are basic SQL commands?\n",
    "- Bonus: My query is: What is the box office performance of a movie resulting in an Oscar win?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Project questions:\n",
    "- Why is it when I ask for the rank, I only see 6 instead of the full 100?  Is there a limit?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- SQL = standard query language\n",
    "- Relational database example with books, authors, genres (i.e. Harry Potter and Stephen King)\n",
    "- SQLite works well in applications not needing human expert support: TVs, game consoles, internet of things\n",
    "- SelectorGadget: Chrome extension to inspect CSS elements on a webpage; helpful for scraping task\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach \n",
    "1. Determine how to get SQL/SQLite on my computer.\n",
    "2. Determine if I'm working with a CSV database or need to parse from a website.\n",
    "3. Research libraries I might need.\n",
    "4. Map out data model for project.\n",
    "5. Determine data types for each attribute in data model.\n",

    "Project ideas\n",
    "1. SQLite database from a spreadsheet: load an existing database into SQL (one line of SQL code that is hard)\n",
    "2. Querying from a CSV using command line.\n",
    "3. Experimenting with joins\n",
    "4. Connecting to a SQL database from R\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitch ideas\n",
    "1. Create SQLite database to demonstrate the three tables: award show data, movie data, financial data.\n",
    "2. Connect to SQLite database (as built in step 1) using R.\n",
    "3. Join award show and movie databases using SQL.\n",
    "4. Scrape data from oscars.com to build SQLite database.\n",
    "5. Completely unrelated project, but mine text data from Facebook using API\n",
