    "So what is an R script? An R script is simply a text file containing (almost) the same commands that you would enter on the command line of R. (almost) refers to the fact that if you are using sink() to send the output to a file, you will have to enclose some commands in print() to get the same output as on the command line. To run a script, let's say one with the name: /home/jim/psych/adoldrug/partyuse1.R you may either use: source(\"/home/jim/psych/adoldrug/partyuse1.R\") on the command line of R OR R CMD BATCH /home/jim/psych/adoldrug/partyuse1.R Let's pause to note a little historical bifurcation that has caused almost as much strife as the question of exactly what the\n",

    "setwd(initial.dir) First notice that the script stores the initial directory and changes to the directory where the data is, and where output will be generated. The libraries necessary for the analysis are then loaded. Finally, the output of the script is directed to a text file, producing a record of the analysis. Then comes the action. After the analysis has been completed, the output file is closed, the libraries are unloaded, and the directory is changed back to where the scripts reside. At this point, you may want to start another script or shut down R.\n",
