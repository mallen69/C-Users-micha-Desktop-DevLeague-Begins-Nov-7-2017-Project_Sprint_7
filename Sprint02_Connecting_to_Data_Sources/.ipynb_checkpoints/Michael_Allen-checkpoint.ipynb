    "\n",
    "#### Description: Create an \"End of Sprint Survey\" in Google Forms and read the survey results in R.  And then create a script in R to automate (simplify) the process of reading it into R.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Plan\n",
    "Here is my overall Game Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create \"End of Sprint Survey\" in Google Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fill out the “Google Form” Multiple times to Create “Mock Data”  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analyze the Results in “Google Forms”\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a Spreadsheet in “Google Sheets”\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use R to read the “Google Sheet”\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Write a “Script” in R to Speed-up the Process of Reading a Google Sheet into “R”\n",
    "\n",
    "7. View the (Survey) Data in R\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "An overall User Story: As a [Technology Instructor] I need to [Understand the basics of Big Data] so that [I can show and convey it to others]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Proposal Sprint 2 - (Using Bayesian Statistical Theory): \n",
    "As a Technology Instructor I need to get exposed to Google Forms and Google Sheets and create a Survey with Google Forms instead of SurveyMonkey (as there are limitations without a paid subscriptionn so that I am able to read the Google Form Survey data in R, and to understand a basic R script. \n",
    "\n",
    "I propose to create an \"End of Sprint Survey\" in Google Forms and begin to learn this tool as it is free to utilize.  I will then fill out the survey multiple times in order to generate mock data.  I'll look at the response data in Google Forms and then create/write the data to Google Sheets (essentially an automatic process).  In R I'll then write the code in order to read the Google Sheets.  Then I'll write a script in R in order to simply the read/viewing of the Google Sheet process in R.   \n",

    "### Five Pitches for the 11/29/2017 Session for Sprint Number 2\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Since SurveyMonkey requires a subscription in order to export data (also to have more than ten questions) so instead create the \"End of Sprint Survey\" in Google Forms and to write a script to read the output in R.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "    (The other four that was not chosen)\n",
    "2. To write a script in R which cleans any field that is not filled out (currently gives a NA Value) so as not to mess up any calculations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Take existing \"End of Course Survey\" data which is in Excel and begin to look at it in \"R\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Take a previous Macro (Script) in Excel that my former Manager (Bosses Boss) wrote in order to help clean the data being exported from SurveyMonkey to Excel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a script to take the values of the text:  \n",
    "Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree    \n",
    "And assign them numerical Values as below:    \n",
    "\n",

    "So what is an R script? An R script is simply a text file containing (almost) the same commands that you would enter on the command line of R. (almost) refers to the fact that if you are using sink() to send the output to a file, you will have to enclose some commands in print() to get the same output as on the command line. To run a script, let's say one with the name: /home/jim/psych/adoldrug/partyuse1.R you may either use: source(\"/home/jim/psych/adoldrug/partyuse1.R\") on the command line of R OR R CMD BATCH /home/jim/psych/adoldrug/partyuse1.R Let's pause to note a little historical bifurcation that has caused almost as much strife as the question of exactly what the\n",

    "During Sprint #2 I have been getting more comfortable using our various support portals during the past two weeks (Jupyter Note Books, Slack, and GitHub).  In addition, started to work with GitBash.  \n",

    "Then for the actual project, I learned how to access first Google Docs, then Google Forms for Survey creation.  I then learned how to send either by email or a URL link the ability for a student/learner to fill out the form.  Then saw how to read the results in Google Forms.  From there a simple Google Sheet creation can be accomplished so the data can be more like an Excel Spreadsheet.  Then to the heart of the task for the two weeks, and that was to utilize R to read the Google Sheet data.  After figuring out the various commands (days to do so) I learned how to write a script in R to simply the process.  And the final thing that I learned is you must be logged into Gmail on the proper email account for the R commands to work. "
