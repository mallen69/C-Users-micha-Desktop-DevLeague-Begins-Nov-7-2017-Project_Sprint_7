    "# Connecting Multiple Data Sources to SQL DB\n",
    "#### 11/29/17 | Natalie | Sprint 2\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "This project connects multiple data sources with DevLeague student information for DevLeague and pulls data into one SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a the Director of Technology I need to identify errors and inconsistencies in the data so that I can develop solutions to address them, and possibly their source.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "Retrieve all existing student data from multiple data sources and place them in one central database using a Python script and PostgreSQL. Data is currently stored in Hubspot, Asana, and a google drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "- How to access the three sources of data using python and tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- How to write a python script from command line, since I'm only taking data in at this step, I don't need to create a full application. A script should work fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach \n",
    "1. Determine what python libraries I can use to pull in data from Hubspot's api.\n",
    "2. Determine how to execute command line scripts in python.\n",
    "3. Create a python script to grab data from hubspots api.\n",
    "3. Determine how to create a postgres db in python.\n",
    "4. Determine how to read in api data and store in sql bd.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 1 Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I tried to create a python application, however I realized that since I'm only taking data in, I don't need a huge framework or application to do so. I can just create a script that will pull data from an api and store it to a database. My first step will just be to work with one data source and just try to get data in. I will then work on creating the db. "
