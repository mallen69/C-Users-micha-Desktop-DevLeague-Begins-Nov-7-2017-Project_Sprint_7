    "> A data model (or datamodel[1][2][3][4][5]) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to properties of the real world entities. For instance, a data model may specify that the data element representing a car be composed of a number of other elements which, in turn, represent the color and size of the car and define its owner.\n",

They store current and historical data in one single place[2] that are used for creating analytical reports for knowledge workers throughout the enterprise.[3]\n",
