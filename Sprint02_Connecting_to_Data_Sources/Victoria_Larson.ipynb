    "1 to 2 sentence description. The first 5 Sections are mandatory. Free form after that, but there are a couple of suggested categories you can use. But really document however you feel the most comfortable.\n",

    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a researcher, I need to understand SQL so that I can work with larger amounts of data more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Figure out what the mail merge is talking about when referring to SQL and do something with that.\n",
    "2. **Create a SQLlite database from a spreadsheet** <- WINNER!!!\n",
    "3. Learn the basics of SQL and SQLlite.\n",
    "4. use web scraping tools so that I can automatically generate reports and save time. (Scrapy)?\n",
    "5. SQLlite to R - which means becoming more familiar with both SQL and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Pitch \n",
    "For sprint 2 I would like to take public parking space data from: https://data.honolulu.gov/Transportation/City-Public-Parking-Stalls/cma8-twyj \n",
    "and upload it into SQLite. I dont really know how to work in SQlite yet so the other part of my project would be to learn the basics of SQLite and what the possibilties are when using it.\n",

    "it is important to put a ; at the end of the word so the word can be distinguished. - I also learned that ; is what ends the phrase - or something to that extent. \n",
