    "Ben - 12/4/17: I didn't see the scraping stuff you were working on in your project documentation, but I think you were getting pretty far along into a good example. You did a good job hacking and trying out different things, but I think you would get a LOT of mileage out of a quick foray into learning about CSS selectors at a more fundamental level\n",

SQLite data commands and connecting to the QUANDL API will be a good exercise. I'm guessing the data model you'll need to set up will be a little challenge so good project there. \n",

I want to do this because it codes observations and may be able to allow me to look at the data and get all the info I want in a quicker snapshot because I can filter out certain fields and only see the relevent data\n",

    "Ben - 12/4/17: I'm having trouble following what you have posted in your documentation. It sounds like you're doing something interesting with google sheets, but most of what I'm finding is console output and not seeing the working code. I recommend cleaning up your documentation so it's easier for you to follow what you're doing. If you want to talk about about what's useful to save and what's not, we can go through that as well. But as a general rule, if no one else can read it, it's probably not that useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I gathered is that you're developing an R script to connect to Google Docs. I see some R code mixed in there with the rest of the comments. I liked the description you wrote up about R Scripts. Another interesting topic for you in the context of this project would be to understand / write up how R stores data when it is read in. This could be both the results of your connection to google spreadsheets or the outcome of your load from the last sprint when you connected to a CSV file\n",
    "\n",
    "In the big picture, I think you're gravitating towards understanding R which I think is probably a good fit for the survey work and understanding you're already bringing in. There's a good [R book](https://github.com/devleague/BigDataAnalyst_Library/blob/master/books/rinanutshell.pdf) in the Class library that I linked to previously. I recommend going through that and all of the datacamp R Libraries to get familiar with various approaches, explanations and skills in your out of class time."

Or clients of your pretty charts) about why they would find them useful"
