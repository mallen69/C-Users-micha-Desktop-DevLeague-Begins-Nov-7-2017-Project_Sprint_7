    "### What I Expect to Learn\n",
    "* I expect to begin my foundational understanding of libraries and perform my first real sprint where I understand how it works.  I imported a pandas library in a previous sprint during a research phase, but did not delve into the details.  I wish to learn at least 5-10 functions/use cases for the library.\n",

    "### Project Pitch\n",
    "- Analyze marketing data set using pandas.\n",
    "- Per the suggestion of Nat, I will either use a marketing data set from a current project at work, or find something similar from Kaggle.  Then, I will use go through a trial process of reviewing each function in Pandas to see what it does and how it works.\n",

    "### Other Notes\n",
    "- Pandas is a dependent library on numpy.\n",
    "- Learned that by inputting a file name into the .gitignore file, you can prevent those files from being pushed to your repo.  \n",
    "- The .gitignore file is edited in Atom or another text editor.\n",
    "- The .gitignore file is hidden, so you can't navigate to it.  I did a save and replace on a whim in Atom and it seems to have worked."
