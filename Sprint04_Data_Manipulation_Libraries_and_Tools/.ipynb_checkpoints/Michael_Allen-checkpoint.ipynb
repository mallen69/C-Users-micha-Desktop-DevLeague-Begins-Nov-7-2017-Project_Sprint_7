    "### What I Expect to Learn\n",
    "* I hope to learn and understand how to write basic scripting so that I can save repeatable task of cleaning & tidying of data, changing categorical data to numerical data with appropriate numerical values, and then perform summary statistics including calculating the mean and standard deviation.  I hope to be able to use this code/concepts as I move further along in this program and also outside of this program in the future.*\n",

    "### Project Pitch\n",
    "- *To continue writing a scrip in R that has already cleaned (somewhat) the Survey Monkey End of Course Survey, but now to change categorical data to numerical data and give specific number values for the categorical answers, and then perform Mean and Standard Deviation calculations on the relevant questions (Columns), and write the data back to a CSV file. And then after doing that, attempt to find libraries/functions which could utimately clean/speed up the coding with less commands*\n",
