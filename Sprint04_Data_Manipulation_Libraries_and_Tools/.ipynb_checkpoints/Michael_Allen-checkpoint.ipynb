I hope to be able to use this code/concepts as I move further along in this program and also outside of this program in the future.*\n",

    "The above references are some of the many that I went to during this Sprint in order to solve the project at hand.  The very last one helped me to resolve an issue of why my plots (graphs) were not appearing on the bottom right hand corner.  I spend hours going over my code as I thought I had inadvertently did something.  But it looks like I didn't.  Simply hit the broom (who knew...) to clear out the plot area so the next time the script ran, the plot would appear.  \n",

    "### Project Pitch\n",
    "- *To continue writing a script in R that has already cleaned (somewhat) the Survey Monkey End of Course Survey, but now to change categorical data to numerical data and give specific number values for the categorical answers, and then perform Mean and Standard Deviation calculations on the relevant questions (Columns), and write the data back to a CSV file. And then after doing that, attempt to find libraries/functions which could utimately clean/speed up the coding with less commands*\n",

    "- *The coding basics of the bar graph under barplot are in place to represent the results  \n",

    "- *I once had the two barplots outputting to a PDF, but somewhere along the line I broke it.  Trying to fix.  Once the R program runs, two PDF files are produced, each representing the bar graph of the  summary statistics (Mean) and (Standard Deviation*\n",
