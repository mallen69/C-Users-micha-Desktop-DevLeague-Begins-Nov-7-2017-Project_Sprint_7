    "### Build a CSV importer to SQLite in python using an object relational mapping solution (ORM). Use SQLAlchemy as my ORM.\n",

    "1. Solution shall be ORM based.\n",
    "2. csv input file shall consist of data belonging to multiple tables.\n",
    "3. input column header names shall identify database table and field names.\n",
    "4. Solution shall \"know\" how to map between input columns and database table-fields\n",

    "- An object relational mapping (ORM) solution simplifies reduces/eliminates SQL coding from my code\n",
    "- Object oriented approach to SQL coding allows for more object oriented python code\n",

    "- Learned rudimentary SQLAlchemy skills.\n",
    "- Learned how to import a single CSV file using ORM\n",
    "- Import a single CSV containing columns belonging to multiple tables, as long as underlying tables have a 1:1 relationship between each other\n",

    " -FROM QUORA (https://www.quora.com/What-is-ORM-object-relational-mapping):\n",
    "The mechanical part is taken care automatically by the ORM.\n",
    "Pros and cons\n",
    "Using an ORM save a lot of time because :\n",
    "DRY : You write your data model in only one place, it's easier to update, maintain and reuse the code.\n",
    "A lot of stuff is done automatically, from the database handling to I18N.\n",
    "It forces you to write MVC code, and in the end your app is cleaner.\n",
    "You don't have to write poorly formed SQL (most Web programmers really suck at it, because SQL is treated like a \"sub\" language whereas it's a very powerful and complex one)\n",
    "Sanitizing, using prepared statements or transactions are as easy as calling a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an ORM is more flexible because :\n",
    "It fits in your natural way of coding (it's your language !)\n",
    "It abstracts the DB system, so you can change it whenever you want.\n",
    "The model is weakly binded to the rest of the app, so you can change it or use it anywhere else.\n",
    "It let you use OOP goodness like data inheritance without head ache.\n",
    "But ORM can be a pain :\n",
    "You have to learn it, and they are not lightweight tools;\n",
    "You have to set it up. Same problem.\n",
    "Performances are ok for usual queries, but a SQL master will always do better with his little hands for the big dirty works.\n",
    "It abstracts the DB. While it's ok if you know what's happening behind the scene, it's a trap for the noobs that can write very greedy statements, like a heavy hit in a for loop...\n",
