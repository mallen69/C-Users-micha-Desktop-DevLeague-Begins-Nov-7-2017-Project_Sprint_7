    "  - Working with SQL w/in your solution is tedious, prone to errors, makes for difficult to read code.  Is there a more elegant solution?\n",
    "  - Working with operations on tables, matrix-like operations. Are there libraries to assist?\n",
    "  - Finding minimual solution front will require a simulated annealing like solution. Are there libraries to assist, so I don't need to write the algorithm myself? "
