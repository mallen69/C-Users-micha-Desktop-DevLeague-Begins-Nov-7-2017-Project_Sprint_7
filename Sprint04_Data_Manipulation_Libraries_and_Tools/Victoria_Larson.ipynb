    "### What I Expect to Learn\n",
    "* In this sprint I hope to become more familiar with libraries that relate to R. I would like to go back to using the birthday data concept with the first sprint and work with it again. My problem with the birthday data is privacy. Jon and I decided that I would import a bunch of different random birthdays and then write a code to autopopulate the names so that I could use the days without breaching privacy. Once that is done then I will go ahead and start using the libraries with that data. I need to explore different libraries from this [link](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2921176/business-intelligence/great-r-packages-for-data-import-wrangling-visualization.html). Hopefully I will be able to do all of these things in the 24 hours but we will see!\n",
    "#### woo hoo!\n",

    "### Looking into the different links on the above website.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Rvest - I could actually use this one to help me scrape names from the web to autofill names in order to make my life easier. That might be kind of cool. \n",
    "##### Lubridate(check) - says it deals with date arithmitec might be complex but might be cool to use. if i can figure it out. \n",
    "##### editR & officeR(check) - very intrigued by both of these. editR looks like it makes and interactive markdown for R and officeR makes it easy to add R generate analysis to a word document or presentation. \n",
    "##### Rcolorbrewer(check) - Create a color palette? Sound interesting for either now or another time. \n",
    "##### googlevis - useful when using google charts?\n",
    "##### janitor - clean up your r code? seems like something that might be useful in the future. \n",
