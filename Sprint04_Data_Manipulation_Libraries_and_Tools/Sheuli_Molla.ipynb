    "HH is trying to map crop suitability data spatially.  I suggest he works in Python, combines data about soil from USGS  and rainfall from NOAA (or another repuatble source) then sees whether his crops of interest are suitable or not for various areas in hawaii based on soil type and rainfall needs. To do this he may have to research different algorithms to overlay the data and compare it for his needs. \n",
