    "I need to be able to figure out if any arbitrary point or polygon is contained within other polygons as a first step.  The eventual application for this is determining whether a given project area is within any environmentally sensitive areas. \n",

    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "For my project, I would like to try out several functions  in geopandas, including map, PIP and within and overlay. \n",
