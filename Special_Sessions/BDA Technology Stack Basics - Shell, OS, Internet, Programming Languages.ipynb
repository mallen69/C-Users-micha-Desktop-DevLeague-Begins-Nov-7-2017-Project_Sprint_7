    "What is a shell? \n",
    "> In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a **command-line interface (CLI)** or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel.\n",

    "> http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an Operating System?\n",
    "> An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Command lines?\n",
    "> The CLI was the primary means of interaction with most computer systems on computer terminals in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on OpenVMS, Unix systems and personal computer systems including MS-DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS. The interface is usually implemented with a command line shell, which is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Command-line interfaces are often preferred by more advanced computer users, as they often provide a more concise and powerful means to control a program or operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What is Machine Language?\n",
    ">Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Numerical machine code (i.e., not assembly code) may be regarded as the lowest-level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware-dependent programming language. While it is possible to write programs directly in numerical machine code, it is tedious and error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses and constants manually. For this reason, programs are almost never written directly in machine code in modern contexts. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### How do humans write machine code?\n",
    "> All practical programs today are written in higher-level languages or assembly language. The source code is then translated to executable machine code by utilities such as compilers, assemblers, and linkers, with the important exception of interpreted programs,[1] which are not translated into machine code. However, the interpreter itself, which may be seen as an executor or processor, performing the instructions of the source code, typically consists of directly executable machine code (generated from assembly or high-level language source code).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What is a Programming Language?\n",
    ">A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.\n",
