# Sprint 2: Connecting to Data Sources

*"Getting" the data you want to analyze means downloading it from websites, connecting to and querying databases, extracting it from HTML webpages, interfacing with APIs (Application Programmer Interfaces) importing and exporting files, and converting back and forth between data formats. Programming languages, databases, command line-based applications and graphical applications each have something to offer*
