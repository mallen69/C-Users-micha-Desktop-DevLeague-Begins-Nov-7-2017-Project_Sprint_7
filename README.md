1. We will begin by creating a fork (personal copy) of the Repository that we want to edit.
2. If you are reading this then you are already on the page that you need to fork. Good job!
3. In the top right hand corner click "Fork".
      - This will create your own copy of the repository. However, right now its only on your github website! you still need to clone it to your local computer.
4. On the right hand side of the screen click the green "Clone or download" drop down.
5. Click "open in Desktop"
  - You may get a pop up that asks if you want to open Github Desktop. You do.
  - Your Github Desktop app will open
  - It should take you to the URL Tab. Click the URL tab if it doesn't.
6. Go to the section where it says "local path" click "choose" to select a folder on your computer where you would like your repository to be. i.e. Documents or Desktop.
7. Do *not* change the name of the folder that you are cloning. Its important to keep the name the same for when you upload your work back to the group repository.
8. Click "clone"
  - This will clone your personal copy of the repository to your local computer.
9. Ensure that your changes are being made by periodically pushing your personal repo to your online github site.
