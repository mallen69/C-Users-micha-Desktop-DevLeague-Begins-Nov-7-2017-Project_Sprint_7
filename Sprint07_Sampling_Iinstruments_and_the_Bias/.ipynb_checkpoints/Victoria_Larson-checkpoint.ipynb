    "#### 2/27/2018 - 3/8/2018 | Victoria Larson | Sprint 7\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "In this sprint I will be taking the hotel STR data (as i have in a previous sprint but this time i will combine multiple pdfs together to create one large table. This way I will be able to analyze the data over time and eventually use it to creat basic plots as well as a dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a resource coordinator I need to construct data from **obscure places** so that I can create dashboards and basic plots. of the resources I am coordinating. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "The goal is to eventually become proficient enough in practice of pulling data from obscure places that I will be able to just upload the obscure data, run the code, and then be able to easily analyze it without hours of organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "- What are the best tools to use when pulling data from PDFs as well as when web scraping. \n",
    "- What questions to I ask so I can organize my data accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- A running list of things that I'm learning and don't want to forget\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach \n",
    "1. Start by analyzing the last project that I did when I used the STR data. \n",
    "2. Step 2\n",
    "3. Step 3\n",
    "4. Step 4\n",
