    "# Some sort of PDF Project\n",
    "#### 2/27/2018 - 3/8/2018 | Victoria Larson | Sprint 7\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "In this sprint I will be taking the hotel STR data (as i have in a previous sprint but this time i will combine multiple pdfs together to create one large table. This way I will be able to analyze the data over time and eventually use it to creat basic plots as well as a dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a resource coordinator I need to construct data from **obscure places** so that I can create dashboards and basic plots of the resources I am coordinating. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "The goal is to eventually become proficient enough in practice of pulling data from obscure places that I will be able to just upload the obscure data, run the code, and then be able to easily analyze it without hours of organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "- What are the best tools to use when pulling data from PDFs as well as when web scraping. \n",
    "- What questions to I ask so I can organize my data accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- A running list of things that I'm learning and don't want to forget\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach \n",
    "1. I will get all of the Hotel STR data into my folder 7.\n",
    "2. Start by analyzing the last project that I did when I used the STR data. \n",
    "3. Ask my questions so I know how I want to organize my data.\n",
    "4. Get all of the data into the same table (binding?)\n",
    "5. Organize the data! (This might happen in step 5)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Day 1 Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Working on my project - pretty easy so far because I am just copying and pasting all of my work from sprint 4 but it looks like I will have to manually do all of the files so now I am kind of wanting to create a function to make it easier for me to throw the file into R and automatically get it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so I decided I only want part of the data on page, I only want to analyze the data for the week and not the running 28 days. I will store the data with the entire page below just in case. \n"
