    "# Project Name\n",
    "#### [03/01/2018] | [Michael Allen] | [Sprint #7]\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "To create a Short PowerPoint Presentation and a Read Me file for Github (Utilized Juypter Notebooks for formatting) for the topic: Survey Design\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a Technology I need be able to teach learners from the beginning about designing a survey so that when it is time to run the analysis the survey was actually designed correctly from the start in order to help answer what the heck they are interested in finding out in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "To research Survey Design content (many of the links were provided by my peers - thanks everyone), create at least a five slide PowerPoint presentation, research GitHub/Markdown in order to essentially duplicate the PowerPoint Material for a ReadMe format that will be readable in GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "What is Recommended for Survey Design\n",
    "How do I incorporate this into the proper format for GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "What was most useful (besides the survey design content) was the quick Markdown tutorial that I took which Ben suggested I locate and take.  \n",
    "https://www.markdowntutorial.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "And by looking at the next line you will see one of the tricks I learned for links..!  \n",
    "[Tutorial for Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach \n",
    "1. To research content for survey design (Tuesday)(Likert/Scale of four/Net promoter score\n",
    "2. Create a five slide PowerPoint presentation (Tuesday)\n",
    "3. Research GitHub/Markdown for Presentation examples (Wednesday \n",
    "4. Add Content, new writing, and Formatting  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Peer Feedback on Day 3\n",
    "\n",
    "After talking it over with Ben, I received the following feedback and decided to make these changes.  He suggested that I do the above GamePlan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here are some overall notes on the skills I learned\n",
    "The majority of what I learned was to be more comfortable right in this environment of Jupter NoteBooks.  From this format I then simply did cut and paste(s) into my NotePad (text editor) for my readme file which hopefully then works in GitHub."

    "Research involves systematic investigation of phenomena, the purpose of which could be for:\n",
    "__Information gathering__ and/or   \n",
    "__Exploratory:__ e.g., discovering, uncovering, exploring  \n",
    "__Descriptive:__ e.g., gathering info, describing, summarizing  \n",
    "__Theory testing__   \n",
    "__Explanatory:__ e.g., testing and understanding causal relations\n",
    "__Predictive:__ e.g., predicting what might happen in various scenarios\n",
    "In the early stages of research projects, brainstorm a series of possible research questions for discussion.\n",
    "Consider open-ended research questions (e.g., What is the effect of s on t?) and closed-ended questions (e.g., Is u better w?).  \n",
    "Once research question(s) are established, consider generating hypotheses, which are generally more specific statements to be tested.  \n",
    "A well-developed research question provides a clear focus for the design and conduct of the study. However it may be necessary to revise the question during the conduct of a study.\n",
    "Research questions can be written in sentences and paragraphs. They can also be numbered.\n",
    "Break complicated hypotheses down into sub-hypotheses.  \n",
    "Each hypothesis should be able to be tested using a single test (or series of related tests).\n",

    "### Successful Survey Design  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Think before you write: Research Objectives, Attributes, then Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Design a Good Instrument (Survey / Questionnaire)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Question Wording\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Stick to One Major Goal Per Survey – Two to Three Sub-Topics at Most\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Question Type and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first step in your survey project is to start writing questions, you’re off to a bad start. The first step in the questionnaire design process is to review your research objectives from the planning stage and then think about the attributes you want to measure in the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are characteristics of whatever it is you’re trying to understand – whether that’s customer, employee or user experience – or whatever. When you’ve identified the attributes of interest, then you can start writing survey questions that generate data to measure those attributes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A well-designed instrument, or questionnaire, is a bit of an art. You’re engaged in a balancing act. You want enough comprehensive data for your analysis, but you want to limit ‘respondent burden’. A survey that takes too much energy to complete leads to lower response rates. Keep the burden on the respondent as low as possible, yet enough to achieve your research objectives. As you design the survey, always think about the work you’re asking the respondent to do.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep it short. If you can’t take action on the findings from some question, then why are you asking it?  Make it relevant. Ideally, all the questions in the survey should be relevant to the invitee. That’s hard to achieve 100%, even using branching logic to tailor questions based on how they answer the current question. But lots of irrelevant questions lead to a non-response. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Survey bias can be subtle or blatantly obvious in a question’s wording, and can take many forms. It is the survey designer’s job to remain impartial and avoid writing questions that lead or confuse the respondent. This is usually easier said than done as writers generally create biased questions due to their own lack of knowledge in a subject or ignorance of other people’s perspective on that subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid running into this type of bias, it is crucial for the researcher to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each question type they will be using. This way the question and its options will not only be chosen correctly but can be tailored in order to provide only the most useful data. For more information on how to use different question types check out FluidSurveys’s video tutorials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To help squash this bias, it is essential to remain neutral in all questions no matter how extreme the topic. It also helps to conduct secondary research to ensure you have a full understanding of the topic in study. Furthermore, a constructive peer review by an expert in the same field of the survey topic will allow you to learn of any problems with your questions that make them confusing or erroneous for the subject of study and its target population.\n",
    "Beyond this, there are several rules that survey creators should always abide by when writing survey questions. Learn them all and reduce your survey bias by reviewing ‘Get the Most Out of Your Survey: Tips for Writing Effective Questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Design the instrument so respondents are unlikely to make mistakes. For example, a question with a double negative will confuse the respondent, or a poorly presented rating scale could lead the respondent to invert the scale.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Organize your survey into sections. Topical sections keep the respondent focused on the topic, and make a survey feel shorter. Have a flow across sections that makes sense to the respondent. Don’t rely on open-ended questions. Free-form text questions have their place in a survey to get more granular detail, but over-reliance on this question form introduces respondent burden, administrative burden, and analytical burden. Better to use well-designed closed-ended questions – questions that yield a number or a check as the response – since these questions are far easier for the respondent to answer and for you to analyze.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of words and phrases in a question is critical in expressing the meaning and intent of the question to the respondent and ensuring that all respondents interpret the question the same way. Even small wording differences can substantially affect the answers people provide.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Question Type and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of survey bias includes the selection of different forms of questions (rating scales, ranking, open-ended versus closed-ended) and the options of answers provided to the respondent. The selections made in question types can have significant impact on the responses received. This is also the case for the options researchers provide for participants to choose from.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re gathering data through phone surveys or in-person interviews, the interviewer’s words and actions will have a major impact on your final results. Online surveys, on the other hand, rely heavily on question wording and design.  \n",
    "You won’t have the benefit of inflection or body language to help convey your questions’ meaning. Phrasing, color choice, and layout will all play major roles in how respondents interpret your questions. Their interpretations will influence your final data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each survey question should follow a logical flow. Jumping around from topic to topic may confuse your respondents and cause them to skip questions or abandon the survey altogether. When determining the order of questions within the questionnaire, surveyors must be attentive to how questions early in a questionnaire may have unintended effects on how respondents answer subsequent questions. Researchers have demonstrated that the order in which questions are asked can influence how people respond; earlier questions – in particular those directly preceding other questions – can provide context for the questions that follow (these effects are called “order effects”).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The order you ask questions matters. Mentioning products, brands, or events can affect how people rate their familiarity and attitudes on subsequent questions. This can be especially harmful in branding and awareness surveys as the mere exposure of a brand name first can influence later questions and findings.  Response options also matter. A respondent might remember a choice that appeared in an earlier question and be more likely to select the response on later questions.  You can often manage many order effects through properly sequenced questions and randomization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even rather benign questions (like asking people their marital status) may prime respondents with negative thoughts as participants recall bad past experiences (like a divorce or death in the family). Moving more sensitive demographic questions and anything that could potentially elicit negative thoughts to the end of a survey when possible may help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people don’t have a flawless memory. Regardless of their intentions, respondents will not always be able to provide you with accurate information.\n",
    "For instance, people can answer questions about their gender and age easily, but when it comes to measuring attitudes and opinions, many people have trouble formulating an answer. To get the best possible data about these subjective topics, use language the reflects how your respondents actually think and talk about the topic you’re asking about.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, people have less precise memories of the mundane behaviors they engage in on a regular basis, and they usually do not mentally categorize events by periods of time (e.g. week, month, year). We should consider appropriate reference periods for the type of behavior we want them to recall. For example, respondents can probably tell you how much time they’ve spent commuting to work this week, but if you ask them how long they commute in a year their recall won’t be as reliable.\n",
    "Ultimately, questions about measured behavior should be relevant to your respondents and capture their potential state of mind.\n",
    "Generally speaking, people have less precise memories of the mundane behaviors they engage in on a regular basis, and they usually do not mentally categorize events by periods of time (e.g. week, month, year).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Survey questions have three distinct parts, and each must work in harmony with the others to capture high quality data. \n",
    "These three parts are the question stem (e.g. What is your age?), additional instructions (e.g. Select one answer), and response options (e.g. Under 18, 19-24, 25+). The wrong combination can leave respondents confused about how to answer a question.\n",
    "Confused respondents lead to confusing survey results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The verbal part of your survey is crucial, but if you’re using survey design elements in an inconsistent way can increase the burden on your respondents and prevent them from fully understanding your survey’s meaning.\n",
    "For example, using different font sizes, colors, and strengths across questions forces the respondent to relearn their meaning each time they’re used. Also, presenting scale questions with different directions (positive to negative on one question, then negative to positive on the next) within the same survey dramatically increases measurement error.\n",
    "Respondents may assume that all rating questions have the same scale direction even if individual question instructions explain the meaning of the scale’s end points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, your objectives need to be as specific as possible. A close second place priority: they need to be measurable by an online survey. \n",
    "Writing a statement of the overall goal of your survey can be a good place to start if you’re having trouble identifying specific objectives. \n",
    "Carefully designing a survey that meets your research objectives can take months.\n"

    "Leading questions. The wording of the question may be loaded in some way to unduly favor one response over another. For example, a satisfaction survey may ask the respondent to indicate where she is satisfied, dissatisfied, or very dissatified. By giving the respondent one response option to express satisfaction and two response options to express dissatisfaction, this survey question is biased toward getting a dissatisfied response.\n",

    "Social desirability.

Each of these portions of survey structure can contribute to survey bias and drop outs.\n",

Acknowledging information like this will allow you to construct the best possible surveys.\n",

    "The most important error that creeps into surveys about isn’t statistical at all and is not measurable. The viewpoint of the researcher has a way of creeping into question design and analysis. Some times this is purposeful, and other times it is more subtle. All research designers are human, and have points-of-view. Even the most practiced and professional researchers can have subtle biases in the way they word questions or interpret results. How we frame questions and report results is always affected by our experiences and viewpoints – which can be a good thing, but can also affect the purity of the study."

    "When you ask customers the Net Promoter Score question, you’re essentially asking them whether or not they’re taking the time to say positive things about your company or brand. Because when it comes right down to it, word of mouth is everything—especially today, as opinions spread faster via social channels and online forums and reviews.\n",
    "Finding out your Net Promoter Score is the easiest way to see how your company is doing in the eyes of your customers. Historically, the positive NPS scores have showed strong correlations to profitable growth.

    "By __definition__ Likert scales are survey questions that offer a range of answer options — from one extreme attitude to another, like “extremely likely” to “not at all likely.” Typically, they include a moderate or neutral midpoint.\n",
    "Likert scales (named after their creator, American social scientist Rensis Likert) are quite popular because they are one of the most reliable ways to measure opinions, perceptions, and behaviors.\n",
    "Compared to binary questions, which give you only two answer options, Likert-type questions will get you more granular feedback about whether your product was just “good enough” or (hopefully) “excellent.” They can help decide whether a recent company outing left employees feeling “very satisfied,” “somewhat dissatisfied,” or maybe just neutral.\n",
    "This method will let you uncover degrees of opinion that could make a real difference in understanding the feedback you’re getting. And it can also pinpoint the areas where you might want to improve your service or product.\n",
    "When to use a Likert scale questionnaire\n",
    "Since there are so many kinds of survey questions, how do you know when you should use a Likert scale?\n",
    "Likert scales are great for digging down deep into one specific topic to find out (in greater detail) what people think about it. So, think of using a Likert scale any time you need to find out more about…\n",
    "how people are reacting to your new product\n",
    "what your team thinks about a recent development in the office\n",
    "how your clients feel about customer service at your company\n",
    "how successful your public event was with attendees\n",
    "…or any other questions where you need to measure sentiment about something specific and you want a deeper level of detail in your responses.\n",
    "If you want to get a bit geeky about it, the deeper level of detail is what survey experts call variance. The more variance you have, the better you know the nuances of someone’s thinking.  \n",
