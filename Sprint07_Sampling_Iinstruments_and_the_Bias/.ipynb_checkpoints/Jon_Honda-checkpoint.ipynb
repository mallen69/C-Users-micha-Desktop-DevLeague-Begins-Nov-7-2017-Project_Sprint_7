    "As a engineer using storm water quality data to design treatment systems, I need to understand how small sample sizes affect uncertainty So that I can develop effective tools to communicate how additional sampling costs will result in reduced stormwater treatment costs. However, it will be difficult to use this data as it is very sensitive. Rather, I will find a publicly available data set and create a scenario similar to the one I face as an engineer."

    "# 4. Project Scope\n",
    "I propose to learn about:\n",
    "1. Ways to describe uncertainty as it relates to sampling size.\n",
    "2. The mathematical relationships between sampling size and uncertainty. Hopefully there is a way to do something like this:\n",
    "   Given current sampling size, identify probability that the average data value obtained thru sampling is not the \"True\" average. Or, that the observed 60 percentile value is not the true 60 percentile average, etc. - basically that the value used in our design is not the sufficiently close to the true value, and we therefore should do something to accomodate this uncertainty.\n",
    "3. Identify how increasing sampling size will reduce probability that our average (or other statistic) based on observation is not the \"true\" value.\n",

    "4. Build a simulator that demonstrats that spending X dollars on more sampling results in Y reduction in necessary remedial actions.\n",

    "https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe  \n",
    "Maybe setup a story where we're going to have to pay to stay at hotel every time we do review.\n",
    "Let's pretend we are a travel agency that books hotels in europe. We base our pricing based on our user rating system. e.g. 3 start hotel rating means you pay $300 per night; 5 star rating means you pay $500 per night. If you stay and feel you didn't get the experience promissed by our rating system, then we'll pay you the difference between what our rating system said you should get and what you actually got. e.g. 5 star rated hotel: you pay 500; but you only got a 3 star experience. We are out 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed rating by paying a small group of people to stay at each hotel. We want to know how many stays at each hotel are necessary to get confidence that our rating system is correct so that we minimize the amount that we pay out to disatisfied customers.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know how much we'll need to spend in order to get a good idea of hotel quality in europe.\n",

    "## THOUGHTS  \n",
    "What does confidence level actually mean?? How is it used with margin of error???\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From the following website:\n",
    "https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/sampling-data/margin-error-and-confidence-levels-made-simple/  \n",
    "*How well the sample represents the population is gauged by two important statistics – the survey’s margin of error and confidence level. They tell us how well the spoonfuls represent the entire pot. **For example, a survey may have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence. These terms simply mean that if the survey were conducted 100 times, the data would be within a certain number of percentage points above or below the percentage reported in 95 of the 100 surveys***  \n",
    "\n",
    "*In other words, Company X surveys customers and finds that 50 percent of the respondents say its customer service is “very good.” The confidence level is cited as 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent. This information means that if the survey were conducted 100 times, the percentage who say service is “very good” will range between 47 and 53 percent most (95 percent) of the time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The website goes on to say that MOE and confidence intervals are linked with number of samples!!!  \n",
    "*Margin of error – the plus or minus 3 percentage points in the above example – decreases as the sample size increases, but only to a point. A very small sample, such as 50 respondents, has about a 14 percent margin of error while a sample of 1,000 has a margin of error of 3 percent. The size of the population (the group being surveyed) does not matter. (This statement assumes that the population is larger than the sample.) There are, however, diminishing returns. By doubling the sample to 2,000, the margin of error only decreases from plus or minus 3 percent to plus or minus 2 percent. Although a 95 percent level of confidence is an industry standard, a 90 percent level may suffice in some instances. A 90 percent level can be obtained with a smaller sample, which usually translates into a less expensive survey. To obtain a 3 percent margin of error at a 90 percent level of confidence requires a sample size of about 750. For a 95 percent level of confidence, the sample size would be about 1,000.*\n",
