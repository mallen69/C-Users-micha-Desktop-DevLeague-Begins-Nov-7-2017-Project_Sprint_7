    "# Sprint 1 - Data File Formats for N00bs\n",
    "#### 11/8/17 | Runjini Murthy | Sprint 1\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "This sprint is geared at introducing the complete data novice to three key file types: CSV, XML, JSON.  It will explain the features of each file type, use cases for each, and demonstrate a process to convert the commonly known CSV to XML and JSON respectively using Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Summary\n",
    "In this sprint, I learned that though CSV is a commonly used data file format for business, XML and JSON offer additional benefits.  XML offers the ability to show hierarchies in data, using human readable language to describe the fields and values, but it is the largest of the file sizes, because there are open and close tags for each element.  JSON is the best of both worlds, using human readable language but preserving data hierarchies in a file smaller than XML.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise of converting file formats also introduced me to Python and command line.  I learned the basics of command line (changing directories, displaying folders, starting Python), as well as writing scripts in Atom to then deploy in the command line/terminal window.  I learned it is a pretty typical exercise to Google/research others' work for code, which is how I found both the converting scripts I used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a marketing analytics manager, I need to understand data formats so that I can compile data sets from multiple sources to do things like establish benchmarks for marketing and sales KPIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Proposal\n",
    "Since my company's data is not only confidential but generally stored as CSV, I would like to increase my knowledge and use of public source data.  I will do this by downloading public data on public art and farmers' markets, which are lifestyle interests of value to our customer base.  I also want to gain exposure to file formats beyond CSV (i.e. XML and JSON), and will convert CSVN files to XML and JSON in order to better understand the formatting and uses of the latter files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "- How do I download files in different formats?\n",
    "- Which programs should I use?\n",
    "- Of the new programs I want to learn - R, Python - which makes sense?\n",
    "- Where would I use Python?\n",
    "- The farmers' market data in XML looks like it opens in a tab on my web browser.  CSV files download as actual files I can open in Excel.  How do I save the XML data?\n",
    "- How do I obtain JSON data file formats?\n",
    "- What is the visual representation I am working towards?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "- Python is separate from Terminal. It needs to be started as a command in the Terminal.\n",
    "- In addition, interactive Python is what is used in Terminal.\n",
    "- Scripts can be written in Atom and then run in the Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gameplan\n",
    "Here is my overall approach:\n",
    "1. Research the public data sets to select a few sets of interest: farmers' markets and public art locations.\n",
    "2. Determine what file formats they are available in and describe them using our data vocabulary: field, observations, cell, etc.\n",
    "3. Compare the data as expressed as CSV/JSON/XML.\n",
    "4. Convert files between formats: CSV to XML, CSV to JSON, XML to CSV, XML to JSON, JSON to CSV, JSON to XML\n",
    "5. Review the basics/definitions of each file format (especially JSON).  Are there particular programs associated with each file type?\n",
    "6. Bonus: Look at data source and try to determine what systems produce these files.\n",
    "7. Bonus: Load data into Python and then export to JSON/XML for file comparisons.\n",
    "8. Research step: Review the basics of R and Python to pick the program to use.\n",
    "9. Sketch out what the end goal looks like.  Is it a table?\n",

    "## Day 1 Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I tried to follow the instructions on Day One.  I missed the editing/pushing step.\n",
    "2. We need to determine 5-6 projects to pitch for the first sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 2 Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reviewed mind mapping\n",
    "2. Reviewed project pitches\n",
    "3. Parking data set: https://data.honolulu.gov/Transportation/Parking-2015/m2gw-xt7z\n",
    "\n",
    "## Peer Feedback on Day 3\n",
    "Nothing really to report here; still figuring out where I'm headed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here are some overall notes on the skills I learned\n",
    "1. I learned that you can edit through Jupyter locally without internet.\n",
    "2. I learned you hit Save and Checkpoint.\n",
    "3. I learned you need to commit to master through GitHub to see changes.\n",
    "4. I learned about syntax in markdown, where numbers will break out new lines, whereas just a simple line break in the markdown format results in one long string of text.\n",
    "5. Sources of data: surveys, automated triggers of actions, formulas/calculations of other data, metadata\n",
    "6. ASCII file = plain text file\n",
    "7. JSON and XML are also text files\n",
    "8. JSON = Javascript Object Notations.  Every observation has the field name and cell value.  It takes up more space/characters.\n",
    "9. XML: HTML is a subset of XML.  Has tags.  Creates nests and hierarchies; properties of parents.  Can export.\n",
    "10. R has readers for all these data formats.\n",
    "11. In this sprint, try opening files in each of these programs.  Also try converting file formats.\n",
    "12. API will give files in one of these formats to be ingested by your program.\n",
    "13. ACTION ITEM: Connect to API to experience this first-hand.\n",
    "14. Example of PoliceOne survey re: good guys with gun/gun laws.\n",
    "15. Ideas for sprint: Research how five news articles sourced their data.\n",
    "16. Relational data - SQL \n",
    "17. I made the mistake again of not understanding the terminal vs. running Python IN the terminal.\n",
    "18. I found the script to convert CSV to XML on this site: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577423-convert-csv-to-xml/.  Here is another article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41059264/simple-csv-to-xml-conversion-python\n",
    "19. Good explainer of the differences in file formats, including explanation of hierarchies that you can include in XML: http://ezinearticles.com/?CSV-vs-XML-vs-JSON---Which-is-the-Best-Response-Data-Format?&id=4073117\n",
    "20. I learned that arrowing up in the command line will bring up your most recent entry.\n",
    "21. cd = change directory\n",
    "22. ls = list\n",
    "23. cd .. = goes up one level in the directory\n",
    "24. Hunter shared this link for further command line instruction: https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/\n",
    "25. Justin noted there is something called \"JSON prettify\" to clean up how JSON files look.\n",
    "26. Detailed, easy to understand link on JSON: https://www.copterlabs.com/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/\n",
    "27. Markdown cheatsheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet\n",
    "28. Python projects for a later date: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/edit\n",
    "29. To show code in a read me file, you need to input three back-ticks and the programming language name: ex. ```python"
