Data generated from the Biki bikeshare system goes through a number of partners before it is accessible to Bikeshare Hawaii. I am learning that with each partner there is a degree of difficiulty to retrieve the data from them. Shooga (website) and Odesa (app) collect payment data but are not very responsive and don't currently share reports with us. PBSC has access to all the data, but don't pull reports on everything possible, and there is a backlog of requests and updates we are waiting on that take priority over reports for the purpose of data collection.

What is BSH and Secure Bike Share's priority list for data collection, and what does the PBSC que look like right now

Single Ride can be a kiosk or the app. The app uses the website, so the server does not distinguish between the app and the website.\n",

    "## Day 1 Work\n",
On Day 1, I asked Secure Bike Share for the data. Right now, they do not collect a report or track where members sign up, it is just inferred based on the membership type. The only path we "know" is that the $20 plan is from the kiosk. MOnthly plans and Free Spirit Pass can be app or website. Single Ride can be a kiosk or the app. The app uses the website, so the server does not distinguish between the app and the website.

In class, Ben and I mapped out communication lines between purchase pathways and servers to determine what communication logs we can extract from Secure and PBSC and I crafted how I could effectively request the data sources I need.
