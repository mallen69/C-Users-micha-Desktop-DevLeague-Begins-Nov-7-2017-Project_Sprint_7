    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to highlight two excerpts from that article\n",
    "\n",
    ">Data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "> The Latin word data is the plural of datum, \"(thing) given,\" neuter past participle of dare \"to give\".[4] Data may be used as a plural noun in this sense, with some writers in the 2010s using datum in the singular and data for plural. In the 2010s, though, in non-specialist, everyday writing, \"data\" is most commonly used in the singular, as a mass noun (like \"information\", \"sand\" or \"rain\").[5]\n",

    "First that it is encoding... *something*. What exactly? Second that there's an inherent plurality to its meaning. Data, as it has come to be useful is about multiple encodings not individual ones.\n",

This is the only way computers are able to store information, as little switches that when accumulated infinitely can represent infinitely complex things. There's a nice little discussion here\n",

In principle it provides a programmer working on their own application, access to the services or functions that are part of another program. In practice these are often connections that are made over the internet. Your internet enabled application can connect to a server with an API set up using internet protocols. The medium of communication is typically data. Your program talks to a server, requests something, and the the API sends you a response as data. How is that data sent to you? Often in one of the data formats above. A nice discussion of the relative values of each data format can be found here:\n",
