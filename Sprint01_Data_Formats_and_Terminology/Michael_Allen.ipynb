    "I propose to first document potential bias from particants on filling out a survey as well as the researcher design biases for the survey tool.  This is useful to understand the story of where the data came from so I know how it is relevant to my action or recommendations.  Secondly to create a quick \"End of Sprint Survey\" in Survey Monday, and then where I will first simulate completing multiple surveys. Survey Monkey has immediate analysis (though I do not know in what format this is in.  I believe I can then export to Excel.  Where then I will look into how to convert it to \"R\" in order to learn this program in subsequent Sprints for equal or better analysis then what Excel offers.  \n",

    "#### Five Pitches for the 11/08/2017 Session for Sprint Number 1\n",
    "*1. In Survey Monkey, create a quick Version 1.0 \"End of Sprint Survey\" so that all of us in the BDA Cohort can evaluate and give feedback to Ben and DevLeague for how Sprint 1 and all the subsequent Sprints went.  Sprint 1 will be to look at the how the data went from conception to an output in Survey Monkey (what kind of data is this) or Excel (maybe at this time). Perhaps another program (\"R\") in a future Sprint.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take existing \"End of Course Survey\" data which is in Excel and begin to look at it in \"R\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Currently I have a home for sale in Ko Olina and have been sent an email link with a statistic stating as of today 10,158 people have seen my ad.  What does this really mean?  Where is the data coming from?\n",

    "4. A z-score (aka, a standard score) indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. A z-score can be calculated from the following formula. z = (X - μ) / σ where z is the z-score, X is the value of the element, μ is the population mean, and σ is the standard deviation.  Where does this data come from?  What might be a good program for analyzing it?\n",

    "\n",
    "*Response bias refers to the bias that results from problems in the measurement process. Some examples of response bias are given below.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Leading questions. The wording of the question may be loaded in some way to unduly favor one response over another. For example, a satisfaction survey may ask the respondent to indicate where she is satisfied, dissatisfied, or very dissatified. By giving the respondent one response option to express satisfaction and two response options to express dissatisfaction, this survey question is biased toward getting a dissatisfied response.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Social desirability. Most people like to present themselves in a favorable light, so they will be reluctant to admit to unsavory attitudes or illegal activities in a survey, particularly if survey results are not confidential. Instead, their responses may be biased toward what they believe is socially desirable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "https://measuringu.com/survey-biases/\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Social Desirability & Conformity*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don’t you agree that recycling is an important initiative for companies to embrace?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Approximately how much time do you spend reading to your children each night?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*On average, how much time do you spend planning meals for your family?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*If it’s socially acceptable (recycling, reading to kids, or caring for your family), respondents are much more likely to endorse and exaggerate. In additional to socially desirable, a number of studies show people will conform to group norms[pdf] both offline and online.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In fact, it’s hard to convince respondents to go against what’s acceptable even when things are clearly bizarre[pdf]. This means respondents will have a propensity to provide the socially acceptable response over the true response.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Yea Saying and Acquiescing*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do you want your coffee machine to have different profiles?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do you use the mail merge feature of Word?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Respondents can tend to be agreeable (acquiesce) and respond usually positively to just about any question you ask them in a survey. One of the best way to minimize this “yea” saying is to minimize simple yes-no answers and instead have respondents select from alternatives or use some type of force choice or ranking.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: While a common solution to minimize acquiescent bias is to reverse the tone of items in rating scales, we’ve found, along with other research, that reversing the item wording can actually cause more harm than good in rating scales.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Order Effects*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The order you ask questions matters. Mentioning products, brands, or events can affect how people rate their familiarity and attitudes on subsequent questions. This can be especially harmful in branding and awareness surveys as the mere exposure of a brand name first can influence later questions and findings.  Response options also matter. A respondent might remember a choice that appeared in an earlier question and be more likely to select the response on later questions.  You can often manage many order effects through properly sequenced questions and randomization.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Even rather benign questions (like asking people their marital status) may prime respondents with negative thoughts as participants recall bad past experiences (like a divorce or death in the family). Moving more sensitive demographic questions and anything that could potentially elicit negative thoughts to the end of a survey when possible may help.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*6.  Sponsorship*\n",
    "\n",
    "*When respondents know where the survey is coming from (the sponsor), it will likely influence responses. If you know the questions about your online social media experience are coming from Facebook, your thoughts and feelings about Facebook will likely impact responses.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This can be especially the case for more ethereal measures like brand attitude and awareness that can be affected from the mere reminder of a brand in the email invitation or name and logo on the welcome page. One of the best ways to minimize sponsorship bias is to obfuscate the sponsor as much as possible and/ or use a third-party research firm (shameless self-promotion).*\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Stereotype*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Asking about gender, race, technical ability, education, or other socio-economic topics may reinforce stereotypes in the mind of the respondents and may even lead them to act in more stereotypical ways. For example, reminding people that stereotypes exist around those who are more technically averse (age), math ability (gender), or intelligence (education level) may affect later responses as the stereotype primes respondents through the questions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bias Doesn’t Necessarily Mean Garbage*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Just because a survey has bias doesn’t mean the results are meaningless. It does mean you should be able to understand how each may impact your results.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*While there’s not a magic cure for finding and removing all biases, being aware of them helps limit their negative impact.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "http://fluidsurveys.com/university/avoiding-survey-bias/\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question Wording*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Survey bias can be subtle or blatantly obvious in a question’s wording, and can take many forms. It is the survey designer’s job to remain impartial and avoid writing questions that lead or confuse the respondent. This is usually easier said than done as writers generally create biased questions due to their own lack of knowledge in a subject or ignorance of other people’s perspective on that subject.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*To help squash this bias, it is essential to remain neutral in all questions no matter how extreme the topic. It also helps to conduct secondary research to ensure you have a full understanding of the topic in study. Furthermore, a constructive peer review by an expert in the same field of the survey topic will allow you to learn of any problems with your questions that make them confusing or erroneous for the subject of study and its target population.\n",
    "Beyond this, there are several rules that survey creators should always abide by when writing survey questions. Learn them all and reduce your survey bias by reviewing ‘Get the Most Out of Your Survey: Tips for Writing Effective Questions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Question Type and Design*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This type of survey bias includes the selection of different forms of questions (rating scales, ranking, open-ended versus closed-ended) and the options of answers provided to the respondent. The selections made in question types can have significant impact on the responses received. This is also the case for the options researchers provide for participants to choose from.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*To avoid running into this type of bias, it is crucial for the researcher to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each question type they will be using. This way the question and its options will not only be chosen correctly but can be tailored in order to provide only the most useful data. For more information on how to use different question types check out FluidSurveys’s video tutorials.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Survey Structure*\n",
    "\n",
    "*One of the most overlooked forms of survey bias comes from poorly designed survey structures. Survey structure usually pertains to the order in which the survey questions are revealed to the respondent, but can also refer to the number of questions per page, the survey logic, the survey length, and the introduction and conclusion. Each of these portions of survey structure can contribute to survey bias and drop outs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*As with the other forms of survey bias, the best way to avoid making errors with your survey structure is through studying how modifying each aspect of your survey will affect your respondents’ reactions to each question. For example, putting the most threatening or personal seeming questions at the end of your survey will decrease your number of drop outs. Acknowledging information like this will allow you to construct the best possible surveys.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "https://blog.cruxresearch.com/2013/08/27/the-top-5-errors-and-biases-in-survey-research/\n",
    "\n",
    "*1.  Researcher Bias.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The most important error that creeps into surveys about isn’t statistical at all and is not measurable. The viewpoint of the researcher has a way of creeping into question design and analysis. Some times this is purposeful, and other times it is more subtle. All research designers are human, and have points-of-view. Even the most practiced and professional researchers can have subtle biases in the way they word questions or interpret results. How we frame questions and report results is always affected by our experiences and viewpoints – which can be a good thing, but can also affect the purity of the study.*"
