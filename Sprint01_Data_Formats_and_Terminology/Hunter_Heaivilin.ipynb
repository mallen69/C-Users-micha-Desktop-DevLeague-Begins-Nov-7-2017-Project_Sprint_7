    "# Programmatically Reading, Writing, Editing, and Converting Data Files\n",
    "#### 11/7/2017 | Hunter Heaivilin | Sprint 1\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "Learning how to programmatically read, write, edit, and convert data files so that I can convert back and forth between data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skill Backlog User Story\n",
    "As a modeler, I need to programmatically read, write, edit, and convert data files so that I can convert back and forth between data formats and make the data interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developing Project Proposals (2017-11-08)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Formats I Work With\n",
    "- Shapefiles\n",
    "- GRID files\n",
    "- Python Scripts\n",
    "- CSV files (e.g., outputs of [Farm Link Hawaii](http://farmlinkhawaii.com/) sales and users)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets I'd Like to Work With\n",
    "- Databases on websites without APIs (e.g., [The Agroforestree Database](http://www.worldagroforestry.org/output/agroforestree-database), [Hawaii Agriculture & Food Products Database](https://hawaiiagrproducts.hawaii.gov/s/), [FAO's EcoCrop Database](http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/home))\n",
    "- Data buried in websites without APIs\n",
    "- Data with APIs (e.g., [USDA Soil Data Access API](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/usda-soil-data-access), [USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service](https://www.nass.usda.gov/developer/index.php), [etc](https://catalog.data.gov/organization/4ae51f6c-467a-4f9d-b40a-2c52e83c326a?groups=ecosystems0617&harvest_source_title=USDA+JSON))\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Projects\n",
    "1. Convert geospatial data to other formats [GIS with Python, Shapely, and Fiona](https://macwright.org/2012/10/31/gis-with-python-shapely-fiona.html) \n",
    "2. Look at the different ways to interact with geospatial files in a gui vs. r vs python.\n",
    "3. Run spatial analysis to cross-tabulate species suitability areas for multiple crops by island through different means (e.g., ArcGIS vs Python vs R); and create a streamlined process to do similar analysis in the future (e.g, ArcGIS ModelBuilder or script)\n",
    "4. Geocode [2017 Dedicated Agricultural Parcels list](https://www.realpropertyhonolulu.com/media/1465/ag.pdf) from site address (or TMK if can find good data) to csv with lat long (via geocodio or similar) and map with Python using Shaply and Fiona.\n",
    "5. Perform similar but using [Organic Integrity Database API](https://organic.ams.usda.gov/integrity/Developer/APIHelp.aspx) to map certified organic farms in the state.\n",
    "6. Convert some ~~shapefile~~ GIS file formats (potentially [local rainfall](http://rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu/downloads.html), which is in GRID format not a shapefile) into csv with lat long points using Python or R.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initially Selected Project (2017-11-09)\n",
    "**Run spatial analysis to cross-tabulate species suitability areas for multiple crops by island through different means (e.g., ArcGIS vs Python vs R); and create a streamlined process to do similar analysis in the future (e.g, ArcGIS ModelBuilder or script).** \n",
    "- Ben suggests finding another kind of data to incorporate or do conversion into additional new data types\n",
    "- Need to spit out a table of areas by island\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions\n",
    "- Need to understand the basics of the structure of ~~a shapefile~~ [GIS file formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats), limitations, loading libraries\n",
    "- Look at conversion tools for various formats (e.g., raster/vector, JSON, csv, etc) and explore how they work and what, if anything, is lost. \n",
    "- Document starting file structure and how it changes through the process.\n",
    "- Understand how to convert shapefiles into csv that can be read by other tools\n",
    "- Understand how to connect to APIs and convert data into mapped outputs\n",
    "- Identify multiple proceses to perform and automate spatial analysis tasks outside of GIS gui \n",

    "### Getting to Know Shapefiles\n",
    "\n",
    "The shapefile (.shp) is a very common vector data file format, for use in geospatial analysis with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), developed by [Esri](http://www.esri.com/about-esri), which also created [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/features/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "GIS systems commonly use both vector and raster data formats. Vector data uses points with lat/long coordinates, lines (pairs of points), and areas/polygons (groups of points) to represent discrete features and boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ESRI Shapefile Technical Description](https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf) offers the following key bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The shapefile (.shp) is a spatial data format that \"stores nontopological geometry and attribute information for the spatial features in a data set.** \n",
    "- **Shapefiles handle single features that overlap or that are noncontiguous.** \n",
    "- **Shapefiles can support point, line, and area features.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An ESRI shapefile consists of: #####\n",
    "- A **main file** (suffix .shp) which is a direct access, variable-record-length file in which each record describes a shape with a list of its vertices.  \n",
    "- An **index file** (suffix .shx.) within which each record contains the offset of the corresponding main file record from the beginning of the main file. \n",
    "- A **dBASE table** (suffix .dbf.) that contains feature attributes with one record per feature. The one-to-one relationship between geometry and attributes is based on record number. Attribute records in the dBASE file must be in the same order as records in the >main file. \n",
    "- **The main file, the index file, and the dBASE file have the same prefix.** For example, counties.shp, counties.shx, and counties.dbf. The prefix must start with an alphanumeric character (a–Z, 0–9), followed by zero or up to seven characters (a–Z, 0–9, _, -). \n",
    "- There can also be projection files. (suffix .prj)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I explored the shapefile of the [Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline 2015 Study](http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/salub/) ([downloaded here](http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data-expanded/).\n",

    "The zipped shapefile (2015AgBaseline.shp.zip) is 11.8 mb, while the unzipped folder (2015AgBaseline.shp) is 19 mb.\n",

    "- **2015AgBaseline.CPG**\t\n",

    "- **2015AgBaseline.shp** which is the shapefile containing the geospatial features\n",
    "- **2015AgBaseline.shp.xml** which is an xml version of the entire metadata of the shapefile\n",
    "- **2015AgBaseline.shx**\n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "- GeoJSON uses the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) geographic coordinate reference system (CRS)\n",
    "- Latitute and longitude are represented in decimal degrees, as opposed to degrees &deg; , minutes, and seconds\n",
    "    - Lat and long are [ordered differently](https://macwright.org/lonlat/) in different file types\n",
    "    - Both GeoJSON and Shapefiles use the order: long lat\n",
    "- GeoJSON has 7 different \"geometry types\", each represented as case-sensitive strings:\n",
    "   - \"Point\", \"MultiPoint\", \"LineString\", \"MultiLineString\", \"Polygon\", \"MultiPolygon\", and \"GeometryCollection\".\n",
