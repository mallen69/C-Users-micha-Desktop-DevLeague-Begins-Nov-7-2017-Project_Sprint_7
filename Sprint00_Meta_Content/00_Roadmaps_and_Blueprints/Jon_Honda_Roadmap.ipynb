    "- *After this class I expect to be able to have an improved ability to explain how I obtained data analysis results. I also expect to have improved data analysis capabilities.*\n",

    "- *After this class, I envision that I will have refined my understanding of data analysis techniques, have connected previously disparate things I've learned on my own, learned new modern ways to code and work with data.*\n",
    "- *I think I will be able to do more data analysis for my main client. Lots of water quality data needs to be made sense of.*\n",
    "- *I think I will be able to run massive simulations at work on water quality data sets - especially trying to run scenarios to find good solutions for my client's water quality problems.*\n",
    "- *This is what I would like to be doing 6 months after this class ends: Presenting ideal solutions based on analysis to my client.*\n",
    "- *This is what I would like to be doing in 5 years: playing with my company valuation models*\n",
    "- *What I want most out of life is to not feel so bound to my current career and this is supporting that desire by giving me more confidence that I could change careers to something more data analysis driven.*"
