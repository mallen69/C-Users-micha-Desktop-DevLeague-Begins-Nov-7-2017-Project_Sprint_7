    "\n",
    "### Prototype Notes: Items that I want to learn this Sprint:\n",
    "* In R, how to: \n",
    "* Determine how many different diseases there are without scrowling through thousands of lines of code: \n",
    "* Be able to calculate by disease and state the percentage of counts per population for that particular disease. \n",
    "* Be able to then group by state the mean percentage for that particular disease. \n",
    "* After getting the mean percentage of all states for that particular disease, determine if there is statisical signficance between one state and another.\n",
    "* Plot on a yearly basis the percentage per disease per state to see if it is apparent if the disease is increasing or decreasing*  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Unexpected things that I learned\n",

    "* Can quickly find the highest sick percentage after calculating the actual percentage\n",
