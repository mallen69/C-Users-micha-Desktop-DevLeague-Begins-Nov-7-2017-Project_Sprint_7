    "### Prototype Notes\n",
    "#### Developing good questions feels a lot like first step of scientific method *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method*:\n",
    " - The method is a continuous process that begins with observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Hypothesis development\n",
    "from:*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Hypothesis_development* \n",
    "A hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model. Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as existential statements, stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of universal statements, stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, inductive reasoning, Bayesian inference, and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. Charles Sanders Peirce, borrowing a page from Aristotle (Prior Analytics, 2.25) described the incipient stages of inquiry, instigated by the \"irritation of doubt\" to venture a plausible guess, as abductive reasoning. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a \"flash of inspiration\", or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. Michael Polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "William Glen observes that the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived \"truth\", or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate ... bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.[77]\n",
    "\n",
    "In general scientists tend to look for theories that are \"elegant\" or \"beautiful\". In contrast to the usual English use of these terms, they here refer to a theory in accordance with the known facts, which is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. Occam's Razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses.\n",

Occam's Razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the confirmation bias which results from entertaining a single hypothesis, strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses.[78]\n",
    "\n",
    "*Results from prototype experiments, snippets of code, things I tried * \n",
    "\n",
    "- from the above, it appears developing multiple alternative hypotheses is a key part of the process Identifying independent and dependent variables may help?\n",

    "e.g. \n",
    "    Observation from looking at data: When it rains, cats meow.\n",
    "    Hypothesis: When it rains, cats meow because they feel wet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pair Show & Tell Comments\n",
    "*Comments from prototype discussion*\n",
    "Ben and I discussed my progress, and feeling that I was getting into the weeds. Some comments:\n",
    " - Overall: sci. method apprroach okay; but we're not interested in hypothesis being about analysis and conclusions at this time (i.e. why cats meow when it rains).\n",
    " - We are interested in validity and quality of data. e.g.: are there reasons to expect the data to be incorrect? Maybe rain and meow were collected separately, and someone combined data together, but made an error in time association.\n",
    " \n",
    " - so, we want to do hypothesis on why observation is valid.\n",
    " - we can also do hypothesis on why observation is invalid, which would satisfy what sources suggest about finding alternate reasons for data correlation.\n",
    " - we also want to answer questions like, are your observations valid? are you seeing a mirage?\n",
