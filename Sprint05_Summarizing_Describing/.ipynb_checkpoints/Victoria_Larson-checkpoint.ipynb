Right now I look at a data set and I dont know which questions should be asked and what can even be accomplished with the data. I am hoping to ask better questions with this data to create more meaningful results. I also believe that the better I am at asking questions the easier it will be for me to manipulate my data instead of flailing around not knowing what my final objective will be.  \n",
