    "Previously we worked on getting acquainted with the building blocks of analytical processes. We practiced working with data structures, and data formats, programming and scripts, using the command line and using libraries.\n",

    "With these building blocks in place, we can begin actually *looking* at our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of exploratory data analysis is to get a feel for your dataset. Understand what's in there, what the ranges of values are, where it might have holes. To the extent that you can understand the underlying natural phenomenon you want to develop a sense of that as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, while you're exploring your data, you want to use the opportunity to develop questions. Questions about what is going on with the data, and questions that the data seems to be able to answer.\n",
